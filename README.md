# Purpose 
The purpose of this repository is to create an extended demonstration of the plmmr package. The focus here is assessing 
the performance of plmmr for real data sets of varying size. For tutorial-style explanations of how to use plmmr, check out 
the documentation website. There are several data sets that 'ship' with the package, and the documentation website has a
vignette that covers each of these data sets.
